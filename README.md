# 🧨 Metasploit & Meterpreter - TryHackMe

This repository documents my hands-on learning experience from the **"Metasploit: Meterpreter"** room on TryHackMe.

The objective of this project is to understand how Meterpreter works in real-world offensive security scenarios, including session management, post-exploitation, information gathering, and credential access.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how Meterpreter sessions operate
- Learn how to interact with compromised systems
- Execute post-exploitation techniques
- Gather system information and credentials
- Explore file system access and process interaction
- Practice basic credential cracking workflows

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Metasploit Framework Basics
- Payload Execution
- Meterpreter Session Management
- File System Interaction
- Privilege and System Enumeration
- Credential Dumping
- NTLM Hash Cracking (Hashcat)
- Post-Exploitation Techniques

---

## 🧪 Practical Lab

### Meterpreter Post-Exploitation Challenge

In this lab, I successfully connected to a target machine using Metasploit and interacted with it through a Meterpreter session.

Key activities included:
- Establishing a Meterpreter session
- Enumerating system information
- Navigating the file system remotely
- Searching and extracting sensitive files
- Dumping NTLM hashes from the system
- Cracking a hash to retrieve the plaintext password
- Understanding attack flow and impact

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Metasploit Framework
- Meterpreter
- Hashcat
- Linux (AttackBox)
- Windows Target Environment
- TryHackMe Platform

---

## 📈 What I Learned

- How attackers maintain access after exploitation
- How Meterpreter simplifies post-exploitation tasks
- How credential exposure impacts system security
- How weak passwords and legacy hashing algorithms can be exploited
- How to structure a controlled offensive workflow ethically

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Advanced Metasploit modules
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Lateral movement labs
- Web exploitation (OWASP Top 10)
- Active Directory attack fundamentals
- Blue Team detection and mitigation strategies
